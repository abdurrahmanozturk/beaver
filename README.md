Beaver
======

Beaver is a MOOSE based application to calculate radiation heat transfer by using view factors which are calculated by Monte Carlo(MC) techniques. This work is started to solve radiation heat transfer problem for pellet heating experiment being conducted in University of South Carolina. It has also has its own UO2 material model using IAEA correlations for thermal properties.

The capability of solving microstructure evolution under irradiation has been under development by implementing models to solve spatially dependent point defects equations(rate theory) and coupled them with Phase Field models.
